#Ben's Tower Defence

A very simple Java implementation of Plants v Zombies style game.  

This has *very* poor graphics (just placeholders really), but if you want a basic game with which to use to give you a head-start in creating your own version, it could be just what you need.

Currently it has lawnmowers, pea shooters, stars, zombies and walnuts.  Press 1-3 to select what to build, and click to build it.  Click on the stars to collect them.
